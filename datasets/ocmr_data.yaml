Description: |
 OCMR is the fist open-access repository that provides multi-coil k-space data for cardiac cine. 
 The fully sampled datasets are intended for quantitative comparison and evaluation of image reconstruction methods. 
 The free-breathing, prospectively undersampled datasets are intended to qualitatively evaluate the 
 generalizability of the reconstruction method.
